# first-week-repo-updated-git
first week repo (week 1 homework) updated as of 2/11/2016

This repo is an update to the very first repo I created in Github.
I am deleting my first repo becuase when I started.  I was brand new 
and did not understant the importance of what to post out to Github.
I inadvertantly posted all my files with personal info I needed to erase. 
This is my most updated version of My portfolio and will conitunally be updated.
